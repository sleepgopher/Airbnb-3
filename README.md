Analysis of the Airbnb data of London

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service with millions of listings. In this project, we analyze the Airbnb data of London and try to use the available information to predict the review scores of each listing. The data sets are available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The prediction is in the file `airbnb.ipynb` and a Python version is in the file `airbnb.py`.
